# Visual-Studio-Source-Stealer
Basically what this does is it takes your repos / sources you've made with visual studio, then zips them up and uploads it to file.io and then therefore sends the file.io link to your webhook. In short you can basically steal all of their projects but remember this is for educational purposes only, don't do this for unethical reasons try it on maybe one of your friends if they're okay with it.

Have fun!
